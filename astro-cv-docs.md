# Astro Paper CV - Additional Documentation

This document contains additional documentation for the Astro Paper CV template, including template setup, Docker usage, and detailed command reference.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Creating from Template

The easiest way to create a new site based on this template is to run the following command in your desired directory.

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create astro@latest --template satnaing/astro-paper

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create astro@latest -- --template satnaing/astro-paper

# yarn
yarn create astro --template satnaing/astro-paper
```

## Google Site Verification (optional)

You can easily add your [Google Site Verification HTML tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) in AstroPaper using environment variable. This step is optional. If you don't add the following env variable, the google-site-verification tag won't appear in the html `<head>` section.

```bash
# in your environment variable file (.env)
PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-google-site-verification-value
```

## 🧞 Full Command Reference

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
