## About

I chose Astro for this project because:

- It's the ideal use case for a static CV site
- I wanted to explore the framework
- The layout is based on the [Astro Paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) template, which provides a clean, professional design

The site includes:

- **Career history** - Professional experience timeline
- **Projects** - Portfolio of significant projects
- **Publications** - Articles and blog posts
- **Certifications** - Professional certifications
- **Skills/Buzzwords** - Technical skills organized by category

All content is managed through Astro's Content Collections system, stored as JSON files in `src/content/`.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theming
- **Deployment**: Netlify (auto-deploys from `main` branch)
- **Content**: Astro Content Collections (JSON-based)
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests
