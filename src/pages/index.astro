      <p>Hi! I am Holger!</p>
      <p>
        I love to develop great software. Frontend and cloud environments are my
        sweetspot most of the time!
      </p>
      <p>
        But tech-lingo is just one part of me:<br /> I find joy in the human side
        of development. Helping others get better at what they do! Listening, communicating,
        mentoring, organizing meetups and events and of course sharing the things
        I learned along my way.
      </p>
      <p>And with all of that: I enjoy learning from that and grow with it.</p>
      <p>
        Apart from that I like podcasting and doing youtube stuff. <br />I weigh
        my beans for a decent espresso in the morning, I love to cook and nerd
        about fancy asian spices. I favor guitars in music and try to play as
        well. I enjoy boardgames (with Terraforming Mars being my favorite).
      </p>
      <p>
