# What is this folder for?

This directory contains the source files and the rendered PDFS for my CV in german and english language.

If those CVs change, please copy the the renderered PDFs over to the /public folder.

# Why not just use the /public folder?

I do not want to over expose the source files of my CV to the public. Therefore they are stored here and only the rendered PDFs are copied to the /public folder.
I tried linking to files over in dropbox, but it was messy. I forgot what the source was and I forgot that dropbox contained productive links.
Until I find a better solution, this is how I handle it.
